Revision history for Perl module Text::MultiMarkdown

1.002_03 2024-09-30T01:04:59Z
	* a final trial version perhaps

1.002_02 2024-09-21T17:48:52Z
	* transliterate_ids changes to transliterated_ids
	* fix some warnings in the tests

1.002_01 2024-09-20T20:34:38Z
	* Trial to handle transliterated or unicode labels, for GitHub #16
	* add transliterate_ids and unicode_ids options
	* add to_html method, which is the same as markdown but should be
	used for anything new. Eventually markdown will be deprecated because
	it's the wrong name.
	* add the multimarkdown_to_html function for the same reason. Use
	that instead of markdown() if you can.
	* Text::Unidecode is now a prereq, for transliterate_ids

1.002 2023-10-31T19:46:11Z
	* new heading_ids_spaces_to_dash feature from Doug Hoyte (#2)

1.001 2023-08-08T07:16:26Z
	* brian d foy takes over the module to fix a tar archive that
	had extra metadata that some tars complained about
	* the Module::Install stuff is gone, so bobtfish/text-multimarkdown#33
	is solved
	* changed shebang of cript/MultiMarkdown.pl so MakeMaker will update
	it (toddr, bobtfish/text-multimarkdown#34)

1.000035 2014-06-19T16:55:00
      - Add a 'self_url' configuration parameter to the constructor. If set, the
        value is prepended to the "#" anchor of footnotes.

       - Metadata is now properly encoded -  special characters (like angles,
         ampersand, or quotes) are encoded to generate valid (X)HTML.

       - Add HTML::Entities as an explicit dependency.

1.0.34 2011-04-26T10:25:00

         5.10.1) (dandv)

1.0.31 2009-10-25T19:19:30
       - Version bump to depend on 2 part version number in latest
         Text::Markdown to avoid dependency issues.

1.0.30 2009-10-22T22:04:40

        - Change bug tracker metadata to the github issue tracker.
        - Fix http://github.com/bobtfish/text-multimarkdown/issues#issue/5
          regression causing specialchars to not be unhashed in footnotes.

1.0.26 2009-07-01T08:35:00
        - Fix to depend on the Text::Markdown package.

1.0.25 2009-06-09T22:52:13
        - Split Text::MultiMarkdown back out into it's own dist.

1.0.24 2008-11-16T14:33:30
        - Add trust_list_start_value patch from Ricardo Signes (RT#40814)
          to enable <li value='X'> output for list numbering.
          This feature is disabled by default.

1.0.23 2008-11-02T18:24:30
        - Ship a release with the correct contents so that the tests pass.

1.0.22 2008-10-23T18:24:44
        - RT#37909 - Fix + in email addresses.
        - RT#40303 - Fix use in Mason by adding "use re 'eval'" to both files.
        - Add SVN repository to Makefile.PL
        - Remove META.yml from source control so it is regenerated 
          automatically.

1.0.21 2008-07-24T08:33:00
        - Fix hard tabs in Changelog
        - Add unit test for core dumps issue from RT#36203
        - Fix POD spelling.
        - Fix warning from RT#34856.
        - Add test for another tab width issue (related to <hr> generation)
          from RT#37769. Fix this issue.
        - More test additions and more splitting the test suites into MDTest 
          modules.

1.0.20 2008-07-11T23:30:00
        - Update README.txt
        - Allow scripts to be used on multiple input files at once (processing 
          in command line order)
        - Update footnote behavior of Text::MutliMarkdown to be consistent 
          with the latest version of MultiMarkdown
        - Added tests for the new footnote functionality.
        - Added tests for all the MDTest corner cases brought up on the list. 
          Noted why / how I differ from original Markdown.
        - Moved all the document tests to MDTest format. I have made MDTest 
          test suites for Text::Markdown and Text::MultiMarkdown, containing 
          **only** the bug fixes and behavior changes I've made, I've imported 
          the Markdown test suite from MDTest1.1, and the MultiMarkdown test
          suite.
        - RT#36537 doc patch to add POD to the scripts from Debian's Gunnar 
          Wolf.
        - Mutilate the list processing somewhat to reduce the compilation
          of recursive regexes, and so stop perl (<5.10) crapping itself
          on lots of input. This isn't the full fix - really shouldn't be
          using recursive regexes at all. RT#37297

1.0.19 2008-04-22T18:34:00
        - Remove auto_install from Makefile.PL, this is a deprecated feature 
          and it shouldn't be being used at all.

1.0.18 2008-04-20T18:54:50
        - Clean up local stuff for settings.
        - Do a little cleanup of intialisation (more needed)
        - Remove copy pasted regexes from Text::MultiMarkdown
        - Fix bug with line breaks in links - http://bugs.debian.org/459885,
          thanks to patches and test input / output provided by Adeodato SimÃ³.
          (See t/37anchormultilinebugs.t)
        - Incorperated MDTest1.1's tests, and made most of the Text-Markdown
          and Text-MultiMarkdown tests in MDTest format.
        - Add and document an accessor for the parsed markdown URLs.
        - Fix html4tags option in Markdown.pl and MultiMarkdown.pl

   
1.0.17 2008-03-17T01:54:00  
       - Add Markdown.pl and MultiMarkdown.pl, which work the same way as the 
         original Markdown.pl. These scripts *are not* installed by default, 
         but you will be prompted to install them when you run Makefile.PL
          
       - Make _DeTab significantly quicker. Text::Balanced is still the main
         performance sore point however. :(
       
       - Re-organise the module code so that Text::Markdown is a standalone 
         module which does not require Text::MultiMarkdown.     
         Text::MultiMarkdown now inherits from Text::Markdown and adds the
         additional MultiMarkdown functionality. This is a *large* change to
         the module's internals, but is much more in the spirit of the 
         original Markdown project (and should silence most complaints about 
         how the code works, and possible even stop John Gruber hating my 
         guts).
         
         If you were using Text::Markdown previously, but relying on an 
         implicit MultiMarkdown feature, this *could be a breaking change*.
       
         Detailed description of any possible user visible changes below:
         
         - Text::Markdown will no longer supports the additional attribute 
           specification for images and links feature, which was not in 
           original Markdown, but were previously supported after
           the code merge of Text::Markdown and Text::MultiMarkdown.

           If you are relying on this features, it is recommended that you 
           use Text::MultiMarkdown (configured as you prefer), as this is 
           not a supported feature in the original Markdown.

         - Text::MultiMarkdown has changed the order of attributes in image 
           tags, the id attribute is moved from the first to the last 
           attribute (barring user supplied attributes). An example of the 
           expected change is included below:

           Old output:  <img id="image" src="http://path.to/image" alt="image" title="Image title" width="40px" height="400px" />

           New output: <img src="http://path.to/image" alt="image" title="Image title" id="image" width="40px" height="400px" />
         
           This is due to the code re-organisation, moving the id attribute 
           around shouldn't affect anything that isn't relying on the 
           attribute ordering (which is meant to be unimportant in HTML), and 
           allows for simplification of the unified code.

1.0.16 2008-02-25T14:24:00
        - Fix bugs with tab_width in constructor / as an option.
        - Fix bugs with tab width in pre/code blocks.
       
1.0.15 2008-02-23T11:13:07
        - Start using ShipIt to package the distribution.

1.0.14 2008-02-21T22:41:33
        - Fix a bug in the packaging of the last version.
        - Add links to other implementations and some notes about them.
        - Add a (failing) unit test for some unexpected behavior reported on 
          the list.
        
1.0.13 2008-02-19T23:54:33
        - Due to the UFT8 support this module no longer works on perl <
          5.8, note this in the Makefile.PL and modules.
        - I managed to ship a module without Makefile.PL, WTF? Really
          need to start using ShipIt.

1.0.12 2008-02-18T22:00:00
        - Text::Markdown - borgborgborgborgborg.
        - Added additional POD documentation.
        - Cleaned up some tests, and some additional test cases.
        - Options to turn off all the extra features introduced in 
          MultiMarkdown.

1.0.11 2008-01-24T00:12:00
        - Fix syntax error in one of the tests. Note to self - just fixing 
          that warning in the test case, then shipping without retesting, NOT 
          SMART!
         
1.0.10 2008-01-23T15:40:00
        - Fix bug with links processing in HTML blocks.

1.0.9  2008-01-22T20:28:00
        - Ship non-broken dist at CPAN (oops, rushing!)

1.0.8  2008-01-22T19:20:00
        - Do not encode amps or angle brackets in HTML comments + test case. 
        - Do not emit title attribute in <img> tags unless we have contents 
          for it. This was a 'feature' of original Markdown where I've decided 
          to go with what php-markdown does (tests updated).
        - Added php-markdown tests (most/all of the regular tests pass except
          the email obfu one).
        - Added php-markdown extra tests (all fail).
        - Added python markdown tests (mostly pass, but marked broken).
        - Add a way of stopping inline HTML blocks from suppressing markdown    
          processing. Feature request from #catalyst-dev 

1.0.7   2008-01-07T16:31:00
        - Encode isn't in core in all perls, add it to Makefile.PL

1.0.6   2008-01-06T13:36:00
        - Merge latest Markdown test suite I can find, and make it all pass, 
          pulling in code from Markdown 1.0.2b8. Things fixed:
            - Inline HTML
            - Lists
            - Metadata skipping by leading line breaks
            - 3rd form of links
        - Implement features to suppress id attributes in <img> and <hX> tags 
          to be able to act more like original Markdown - now almost ready to
          steal Text::Markdown (would want to turn off tables / citations and
          bibliography for that)
        - Move almost all the global variables into instance data.
        - Fix unicode issues from CPAN.org's RT#27482
        - Remove call to srand, it's not smart to do this more than once.
        
1.0.5   2008-01-04T18:07:57
        - Add Markdown and MultiMarkdown test suites.
        - Fix a big bug introduced in 1.0.4 in citations
        - Fix footnotes (and other small things) to match the test suite
        
1.0.4   2008-01-02T02:03:50
        - Refactor so that the processor instance has the same set of        
          persistent options as on the ->markdown method itself.
        - Change all functions to be instance methods, moved a chunk of the 
          global data to the instance. The rest will follow shortly.
        - The test suite now tests a reasonable set of the Markdown and 
          MultiMarkdown syntaxes.
        - All known options and metadata keys have been documented.
        
1.0.3   2007-11-24T20:22:00
        - way to keep me accountable, CPANTESTERS! Maybe I shouldn't have
          Test::Pod::Coverage enabled unless it actually checks out. Added some
          fairly useless stubbed METHODS to POD and moved POD around a bit.
          
1.0.2   2007-11-24T14:00:00
        - move to Module::Install and clean various things up, mostly to make
          CPANTS happy.

1.0.1   2006-10-20T00:00:00
        - include patch from Uwe Voelker to allow setting of options in
          markdown(); also added a test case from Uwe. Thanks, Uwe!
          Also updated changelog references in POD somewhat.

1.0.0   2006-08-22T00:00:00
        - first release
